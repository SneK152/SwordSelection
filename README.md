# Sword Selection - A Minecraft mod for Forge
This all-new Minecraft mod adds in new medieval-inspired sword variations. Over time, many swords have popped up over the years, coming in new builds and forms. Sword Selection aims to add many of these famous and popular sword variations into Minecraft with some special twists. You can find the changelog and full list of features below.

Update 1.1 has just released, adding the new dagger variation and bringing some gameplay changes.

# Features

NOTE: The attack speed of a specific variation is the same no matter what the tier is. For example, all the sickles have the same attack speed.

### Sickles

Originating in the Neolithic Era, this special harvesting tool was also considered as a weapon because of its unique hook properties. In the Sword Selection mod, they are slightly faster than the average sword but do a little less damage in exchange. It can be used as a replacement for a hoe and can harvest crops too. Can also be dual wielded.

Attack Speed = 3

Attack Damage:
- WOOD = 1
- STONE = 2
- IRON = 3
- GOLD = 1
- DIAMOND = 4
- NETHERITE = 5


### Broadsword

These bulky swords first came into use during the Medieval Ages as a double edged, sharper sword than its predecessors. As part of Sword Selection, they are a hefty weight to hold, due to their immense width and power. This sword is extremely powerful and has the power to send your enemies reeling with increased knockback, although it does give you a speed debuff due to its weight.

Attack Speed = 0.7

Attack Damage:
- WOOD = 6
- STONE = 7
- IRON = 8
- GOLD = 6
- DIAMOND = 9
- NETHERITE = 10

### Longsword

The longsword is a slightly thin sword that was widely used during the Renaissance period in Europe. Today, the longsword holds a special place in the Sword Selection mod. It is slightly thinner than the basic sword and is similar in terms of combat. However, it has special properties. When striking a mob, it will also deal damage to mobs within a certain radius around it. It also has a chance of poking a mob and dealing a small amount of damage when in your hand.

Attack Speed = 1.8

Attack Damage:
- WOOD = 4
- STONE = 5
- IRON = 6
- GOLD = 4
- DIAMOND = 7
- NETHERITE = 8

### Dagger
<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vz8cs81/irondagger.png" width="16%" alt="iron dagger" />

The small knife known as the dagger has been used throughout human history as not only a means of self defense, but a proprietor of close combat. In this mod, the dagger is a unique weapon. With a reach distance of only 2 blocks, it redefines the concept of short range. This dagger is also deadly in the wrong hands. Right clicking it will produce a special attack in which the dagger will be injected into the mob you're looking at, essentially poisoning them as they start dying. If a mob dies to the hands of a dagger special attack, it has a 50 percent chance of dropping an iron ingot.

Because of the limitations of how a dagger can be wielded and forged in real life, only the iron tier exists. This has a chance of being changed in the future.

Attack Speed = 4

Attack Damage (IRON) = 3

### Crafting
As of version 1.0, you can input an iron, stone, wood, gold, diamond, or netherite sword into a stonecutter to get their respective variations. However, a future feature may include a custom tile entity that can craft the different variations.

### Other Features

#### Config Files
This mod is highly configurable. As of now, the configurable details are the durability offset of each variation (as in how far the durability is from the regular sword) and a toggle for dual wielding.

# Changelog
Here is the changelog for the recent patches/updates to the mod.

## 1.1

Gameplay changes:
- Holding the broadsword now gives a debuff of slowness due to its heavy weight
- Holding the longsword has a chance to poke/attack enemies in a certain range of the player
- The iron dagger is now in the game
    - Small reach distance of 2
    - Right click special attack inserts the dagger into the mob you're looking at which poisons it and gives it a 50% chance of dropping an iron ingot

Technical changes:
- Updated the mod to the latest 1.16.5 official mappings

## 1.0
Version 1.0 is now released. This means the mod is now in a fully playable state and has a complete list of features.

Gameplay changes:
- All the missing tiers (wood, gold, diamond, netherite) are now added for every variation, as well as recipes, models, and textures
- Attack speed is now the same for a single variation, and does not change per tier

Technical changes:
- Config files are now in a ready to edit stage, with variables for dual wielding toggles, broadsword knockback multiplier, and the durability offset of all variations

## Future Plans
Currently, I am focusing on adding new tiers of the existing sword variations. Iron and stone have already been completed, but there will be a wood, diamond, and netherite tier of each variation as well. 

Not only that, but there are plans for more variations to come in future updates. These include:
- Throwable daggers/knives
- Scythe
- Glaive
- Hammer
- Gauntlets (gloves that give more damage)
- Whip
- and much more...

In addition to more variations, here are some more plans for miscellaneous things that may be added into the mod in the future (in order of likelyness from most likely to least likely):
- Additional config variables to adjust more aspects of the mod
- Custom tile entity that can craft and uncraft each sword variation

# Technical Info
Sword Selection is built using Minecraft Forge version 36.1.0 and MCP for Minecraft 1.16.5. It is licensed under the MIT license. You can feel free to use this mod in a modpack as long as you credit me as the author.

As for future versions, I am planning to port this mod to 1.17 once Forge has released for it. 
A Fabric version is most likely not going to happen anytime soon, however it is a possibility. Feel free to port this mod to Fabric if you want to.

NOTE: This mod is a work in progress (WIP). This means that not all features are in the game yet. It is still in beta and features are being added continually. If you would like to help in the development of this mod, you can message me on CurseForge. 

# Using Sword Selection
If you want to run this mod in Minecraft, you have a few options. The best and most reliable way to access my mod is through CurseForge. Click the link in the About section of this repo to be redirected to my mod page on CurseForge. There, you can access my compiled builds as they release. 

If for some reason CurseForge doesn't work for you or you don't prefer to use it, I also post compiled builds in the releases tab of this repo. You can find the JAR download there as well.

Finally, you can build the mod yourself using the source code. However, this is NOT RECOMMENDED for people who don't have prior knowledge about computers. To do this, you can download the zip file from the home page. Or, you can clone the repository using the following command:
`git clone https://github.com/SneK152/SwordSelection.git`

Next, you want to make sure you have the Java 8 JDK installed, or else you may not be able to compile the build and it will throw an error. You can find JDK builds at [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net). 

Open your OS terminal and cd into the project folder. You should be in the folder with the gradle files and the src folder. Use `gradlew build` for Windows or `./gradlew build` for MacOS/Linux to build the project. It will run for some time, then output the JAR file in build/libs. Drag and drop that into your mod folder and you're good to go!
