# SwordSelection
 A Minecraft mod that allows you to create and select sword variations such as daggers, sickles, and broadswords. WIP

This is my first Minecraft mod for Forge. Once it is working and stable, you can find compiled releases on Github and CurseForge.

I will consider making a Fabric port for 1.16 and/or 1.17.

A 1.17 port is planned once Forge releases their first stable build.
