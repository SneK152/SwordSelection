# SwordSelection
 A Minecraft mod that allows you to create and select sword variations such as daggers, sickles, and broadswords. WIP

This is my first Minecraft mod for Forge. Once it is working and stable, you can find compiled releases on Github and CurseForge.

I will consider making a Fabric port for 1.16 and/or 1.17.

A 1.17 port is planned for Forge.

# Info

Currently, the added sword variations are as follows:
- Iron sickles
- Iron broadsword

The planned sword variations include: 
- Wooden, stone, diamond, netherite sickles
- Wooden, stone, diamond, netherite broadsword
- Daggers that are throwable
- Scythe
- Scimitars (long knife)

Currently, the features of this mod are as follows:
- Iron Sickles: A slightly faster yet less damaging variation of a sword. Can also work as a low-tier pickaxe
- Iron Broadsword: A very bulky and slow sword variation that does much more damage, and also knocks back the target
- Input an iron sword into a stonecutter to create these two sword variations

Planned and possible features:
- Dual wielding for scimitars and sickles
- Custom crafting table-esque tile entity that can create sword variations
- Config files for each sword variation and how to make them

# Usage

You can find compiled builds in the releases tab or on [CurseForge](https://www.curseforge.com/members/snek_152/projects). 

Alternatively, if you want to compile the source yourself, run the command `git clone https://github.com/SneK152/SwordSelection.git` in the directory you want the folder in, or download and unzip the repo directly from GitHub. Open a command prompt in the newly created folder and execute the command `gradlew build` or `./gradlew build` depending on your operating system. This will output a .JAR in build/libs. Drag and drop this mod file into your mods folder in your Minecraft directory.
